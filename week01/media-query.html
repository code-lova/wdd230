            <h2>1 Nephi 3:7</h2>
            <p>
                And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto my father: 
                I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, 
                for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, 
                save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish 
                the thing which he commandeth them.

            <h2>Alma 4:3</h2>
            <p>
                And so great were their afflictions that every soul had cause 
                to mourn; and they believed that it was the judgments of God 
                sent upon them because of their wickedness and their abominations; 
                therefore they were awakened to a remembrance of their duty.
